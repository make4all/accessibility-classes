# What is a visualization?

???
Alt text for this slide: seven different complex dashboards that are too tiny for a sighted person to understand show a variety of visualizations from barcharts to maps

---
# Why are they useful

![:img Three visualizations. From left to right: An election map of the united states with red and blue states indicating political affiliation during the 2020 election labeled "Politics: CNN"; A line chart from early in the COVID epidemic comparing numbers of cases in different countries labeled "Health: Financial Times"; and a map of the Ukraine titled "Areas of Russian military control in Ukraine" labeled "Conflicts: BBC",100%, width](img/visualization/three-examples.png)


Visualizations inform the public and guide decision-making, policy, and business.

# Some questions to consider about information access

Who can access visualizations that other people have created?

Who can create accessible information?

How do we prioritize efforts to make data accessible?

How do we support the full data science lifecycle?

.footnote[Source: Potluri]

---
# Who can access visualizations?

Due to the inaccessibility of online data visualizations,
screen-reader users answered questions 62% less accurately and spent
211% more time than non-screen-reader users (Sharif, 2021).

Elavsky [Chartability](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/cgf.14522): 250 visualizations; mean 320 errors per visualization; 0 visualizations error-free

---
# What is WCAG's equivalent for visualizations?

POUR still applies

Elavsky expanded them for [Chartability](https://www.frank.computer/chartability/) to also include 
- "Compromising" 
- "Assistive"
- "Flexible"

Quick tour and then some research work

# Perceivable (1/3)
Use high contrast, redundant encodings

# Perceivable (2/3)

Perceivable visualizations may look slightly different from the original as in this visualization with improved contrast

![:img Two visualizations that different only in the use of higher contrast colors. Both show an election map of the united states with red and blue states indicating political affiliation during the 2020 election,100%, width](img/visualization/improved-contrast.png)

# Perceivable (3/3)
Or they may require a total redesign

![:img Two linecharts that differ in the use of color; and the choice to use small multiples to represent the different lines instead of overlapping them,100%,width](img/visualization/multiples.png)

# Basic ALT text

[Good summary](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)

- alt=".red[Chart type] of **type of data** where *reason for including chart*" 
- also include a link to a data table 

Screen-reader users perform a holistic exploration first and then drill-down into the data (Sharif, 2021).

---
# Aside: Lots of other ways to make visualizations perceivable

- Tactile graphics (3D printing, swell paper, etc) [pass around]
- Sonification 
- Providing a data table 

---
# Operable (1/2)

Visualizations are often made of of many datapoints, and moving around them can require tabbing through them all! Also  visualizations might be interactive (e.g. to filter data)

![:img Two bar charts showing building and product information. In the first a bar labeled "Building A; Product category 2; Count 15" is highlighted and the VoiceOver window showing "Building A. Product Category 2. Count 15. Bar 2 of 3. Toggle button" is visible. In the second the bar has been selected and the VoiceOver window states that,  40%,width](img/visualization/bar-with-aria.png)

---
# Operable (2/2)

- Order and hierarchy need to be correct
- Functionality should also be described. Use ARIA tags
- Use redundant cues (e.g. Aria roles and visual state)
- Make sure things aren't too small

---
# Understandable; Robust

- Descriptive, clear titles, axes labels, etc.
- Good ALT text
- Data table available
- Simple language
- Work with screen readers
- ...

---
# New Areas for Access (Compromising and Flexible)

**Compromising** (U+R), lets people choose how to consume information

About agency and control!
- Example: Providing a data table is compromising (good)
- Example: A user filters and then cannot share that state or return to it easily (bad) 

**Flexible** (P+O+R), respects user settings such as style changes

---
# New Areas for Access (Assistive)

**Assistive** (P+U), reduces labor required for access.

![:img Two scatterplots showing a weighted prediction score. In the first a single point has been selected and the screen reader says "Product 3. Cost $88. Weighted prediction 37". In the second a cluster has been selected and a hover box shows "Pacific northwest market patterns have produced a cluster...". In addition the screen reader says the same thing, 100%,width](img/visualization/perceivable.png)

# Pause and discuss: 

Could compromising, flexible and assistive improve WCAG?

Are they already in WCAG?

# This all gets much more complex with dashboards

Approximately **4 months of iterative co-design** w/ co-authors Tim & Darrell (both legally blind)

30-60min **Zoom sessions every 1-2 weeks**
- Started with formative questions about prior experience and challenges with visualizations and dashboards
- Iteratively prototyped and tested an alternative user experience 

.footnote[[Srinivasan & Mankoff 2023](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3597638.3608405)]

---
# Guidelines (1/2)

1.  Use a consistent structure and create content hierarchies to aid navigation
  - Dashboards can be very complex
  - ALT text has many parts (overview, layout, what is interactive, updates during filtering, etc)
2. Descriptions should summarize the dashboard’s structure and interactivity, and highlight key data facts.
3.  Description’s structure should be optimized for screen readers.

---
# Example layout summary:

.left-column50[
.quote[There is a filter region with 1 form control at the top followed by a dashboard canvas structured as a grid with 3 rows. A summary of the grid's content is as follows: ...]
]
--
.right-column50[
![:img American community survey results dashboard with the three regions described in the quote., 100%,width](img/visualization/dashboardeg.png)

]

---
# Guidelines (2/2)
Interactive visualizations require special accessibility considerations

1. Present explicit filtering widgets for interactive charts and place all filters in a separate region.
2. Summarize key changes after data updates.
3. Change descriptions should support different modes of analytic inquiry.

---
# Example Change Description

.quote[8 blocks updated. Key changes for the current selection of College Type:
Public compared to the previous selection of College Type: Private
include:

- Average Tuition Cost reduced by 21105 from 29548 to 8443.
- Average Price for out-of-state students reduced by 10366 from 43155
to 32789.
- ...
]

---
# Lots of other research

- Automatic alt text generation
- Question and answer systems that let you explore the data associated with a chart as well as chart contents
- Taxonomies of alt text and preferences for level of detail
- Better access to specific types of visualization
- Sonification tools
...

**Almost all of it focuses on nonvisual access** 

**Almost all of it positions disabled people as consumers**

# QUICK BREAK

Good time to stand and stretch

# Can BLV people create new information?

Are they included in the employment opportunities and learnings associated with data science?

Can they access information when someone didn’t already decide it needs to be accessible
- Maps and other individualized needs
- Live data exploration

# Can non programmers create visualizations?

## Generative Design

It is a common approach to support end users (used a lot for fabrication).

Lets each user specify their information priorities and preferred representations in familiar terms through a simple GUI

# Multimodal output

.right-column[
Speech output
 - e.g. for new maxima
 
Sonification
 - e.g. pitch -> height

Laser cut output
 - Totally different model...

# What about diagrams?

Working right now on node link diagrams

DOJ rule requires lots of them to be remediated
- We are using GAI to extract the data
- Building an authoring interface for verification
- Providing multimodal options for output

---
# Inclusion throughout data science 

Data collection - not particularly supported (even coding tools very inaccessible)

Data cleaning - not studied to my knowledge

Modeling and Analysis - Common tools like Jupyter Notebooks wholly inaccessible

Representation - Accessible visualization & data physicalization are the big opportunities
