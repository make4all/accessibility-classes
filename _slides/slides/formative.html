# My approach to disability inclusion

1. Advocate for the inclusion of people with disabilities in higher education ad research
2. Seek out and support students who have first person experience with disability (and are also excellent students)
3. Work to be an ally to them so that they can succeed
4. Engage with the disability community in selecting problems and sharing results
5. Include disabled community members who contribute strongly to projects

???
In my own work, I try to do the following. Can any of this translate?

How can we translate this into need-finding? [Ed]({{site.discussion}}/4882184)

<!-- (reminder) -->

<!-- Alternative: Ethical need-finding: Complicated, especially in industry settings -->

# Translating to Need-finding  (1/4)

Participatory Design/Research:  Emanates from design & technology field, has been specifically used in Assistive Technology & HCI research; and applied in education and healthcare settings; children & older adults

---
# Translating to Need-finding  (2/4)

Participatory Design/Research

- Working directly with users (& other stakeholders) in the design of systems

---
# Translating to Need-finding  (3/4)

Participatory Design/Research

- Working directly with users (& other stakeholders) in the design of systems

- Users are actively involved in setting design goals and planning prototypes

  - Contrasts with methods where user input is sought only after initial concepts and prototypes have been produced (i.e. PD is more than user-testing)

---
# Translating to Need-finding  (4/4)

Participatory Design/Research

- Working directly with users (& other stakeholders) in the design of systems

- Users are actively involved in setting design goals and planning prototypes

- Early and continual participation of intended users to produce better technologies that better suit the needs of users

# Participatory Methods in A11y (1/3)

- Aims to engage participants in the design, conduct and evaluation of products/research with the construction of non-hierarchical  relations  
  - Participants encouraged to own the outcome by setting the goals and sharing in decisions about processes 
  - “Nothing about me, without me”

# Participatory Methods in A11y (2/3)

- Aims to engage participants in the design, conduct and evaluation of products/research with the construction of non-hierarchical  relations  
- Ensures research topic is one that people with disabilities consider worthy of investigation
  - Asking people with disabilities to act as consultants or advisors to projects
  - Provision of support, training and payment so that people with disabilities can undertake their own research


---
# Participatory Methods in A11y (3/3)

- Aims to engage participants in the design, conduct and evaluation of products/research with the construction of non-hierarchical  relations  
- Ensures research topic is one that people with disabilities consider worthy of investigation
- Other methods 
  - Narrative research: Life history, biography, oral history
  - Focus groups, interviews
  - Action Research


---
# *Accessible* Participatory Methods

- Accessibility doesn't come by accident when planning studies
- All research should be accessible research (regardless of if it is accessibility research)
- You have to make your system accessible (using inspection techniques) *before* doing this 
- We will discuss accessibility *for evaluators* and *for participants* today

# An Example

Supposed you want to co-design a new directional control system for
 increased independence among paddlers who are blind.

<img src="https://markbaldw.in/images/coop_in_action.jpg" alt="a blind paddler in a solo outrigger canoe trains with the help of a special remote ruder control device visible as a red box on the bcak of the canoe" width=50%/>

# Tasks List from Anticipate and Adjust
1. Assign Tasks
2. Train study team 
3. Handle recruitment 
4. Pilot with people with disabilities
5. Run the Study
6. Analyze the data

---
# Assigning tasks: considerations
- access needs
- effects of familiarity with the task
- personal preferences
- other institutional constraints

---
# Training: considerations
- Ensuring that they address access needs and communication support from recruitment onward
- Providing basic DEIA training as needed so that all those with participant contact know basics. 
  - Don’t be overly sensitive (don’t overcompensate)
  - Don’t rely on useless cues (audio/visual) to convey encouragement
  - Monitor participant fatigue carefully
  - When to help and when to end a task if participants have trouble
---

# Recruitment: considerations
As a person already connected to the disability community, the team determines that Jay will be most likely to be trusted, and to identify opportunities to build trust throughout the recruitment process. 

Recruitment typically raises a number of access issues
- Are your recruitment materials accessible
- How will you find participants (next slide)
- How will you compensate participants?

---

# Recruitment: More considerations

Finding participants may require careful work. In this case, a lot of those problems are solved by partnering with a particular community organization. Some considerations:
- How much do you know about the group your are targeting and what to expect from/of them?
- Will they see you as trustworthy? 
- Are you giving them enough agency in the study process?
- Maybe start with gatekeepers
  - Negotiating access often requires working with gatekeepers
  - Participants may see researchers as “just another professional, conducting professional surveillance”

---
# Piloting: Considerations

- First, revisit accommodations plan
- Next, have sufficient prep time
  - Hire interpreters (at least 2 weeks in advance)
  - Print out accessible study materials, consent form, etc
  - Understand (and possibly prepare) the space that the team will work in
  - Have compensation ready

---
# Piloting: Considerations

- First, revisit accommodations plan
- Next, have sufficient prep time
- Finally, reflect and iterate to address any new concerns


---
# Running the study: Considerations

The team should be well prepared. However, it is still important to monitor both the team's and the participants' needs and adjust as accessibility concerns arise. 

Similar to piloting a study 

---
# Analyze the Data: Considerations
- Data analysis tools may not be accessible
- Team members may have different needs with respect to written versus audio transcripts
- **Member Checking**

---
# Special Considerations

Children -- Assent versus Consent

Nonspeaking individuals
- Can be a tendency for support workers to speak on behalf of the person with a 
disability

Find ways to support participants with disabilities to become researchers/designers in their own capacity

Address power dynamics

---
# Other Concerns to Address

- Accountability and ownership
  - Designer/Researcher is accountable to the funder- who owns the research agenda?
  
--

- Moving toward Emancipatory design
  - Emancipatory design: Brings about a change, emancipation
     - Designer/Researcher is accountable to participants with disabilities. Their skills are at the disposal of the people with disabilities
     - Under the control of disabled people and pursued in their interests (Mike Oliver)
