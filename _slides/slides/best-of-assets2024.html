# Feedback about class

Overall feedback is really positive on content, hybrid learning, and flexible deadlines

Some frustration has been brewing for a while about inconsistencies with the assignments, made worse by misunderstandings about grading and the website structure

We are trying to triage changes that are do-able for this year; other feedback will help in future



---
# Some context

- This is the second year the course is taught, and I made some significant revisions. This seems to have added new opportunities for inconcistencies that I didn't account for
- Every assignment has a spec, and a template, because last year the lack of a template was confusing for students. Clearly we haven't solved this the *right* way, we are still learning.
- Since the class has no limit on regardes, no penalty for regrades, and re-assesses the same material multiple times in multiple assignments, you don't have to adjust what you do at the last minute. Every competency will *still* be graded again at this stage. 

Mistakes are not possible to eliminate entirely, especially in *second* offering. Trying to focus on the ones that cost you time. 

???
- We are trying to catch and address inconsistencies as fast as we can
- Now on to your feedback

---
# Assignment feedback

[future] Very clear that you want everything in *one* place. 

[current] Trying to minimize mistakes in remaining assignment spec (final project) through better proof reading
a

other comments
- [future] Updated examples 
- [philosophical] More/less group work (BOTH)
- [current] Better overviews (Bullets of requirements; Visual overviews of assignments, Overview of competencies <--> assignments, etc)
- [current] Setup time <-> crip time & access requiring time

---
# Grades
[current] trying to give you more transparency. 

[access conflicts] Competency based grading is
   - *slow
   - *detailed and helpful 
   - +amazing / accessible
   - +confusing / inaccessible

[current] 2 day late policy is very helpful

---
# Hybrid offering
- [access conflicts] Lots of thoughts, positive AND negative about zoom buddies and their impact on people remote and in person.  Overall, *most* comments were positive about hybrid structure
- [current] Audio connection for zoom buddies might help -- We are trying to come up with ideas, an welcome input
- [current] We need in person volunteers to make this work well

---
# Class content 
- [keep] Liked guest speakers
- [keep] Liked readings
- [keep] Liked small group discussions w/ Ed
- [keep] Liked assignment content
- [future] questions about how to simplify the implementation assignment, especially for those without websites

---
# Other
- [future] Some disagreements about discussion platform
- [keep!] Lots of praise of TAs (and request for more of them on Ed)
- [keep] Thank you for weekend office hours
- [keep] Appreciate week planning posts
- [current] Request for more group activities in section
- [future] simplify the hierarchy in the website
- [future] weekly schedule view

# Announcments

Fabrication week next week

Need a laptop in section 

Section is loud

No hybrid section during fab week

---
# Final Project

Open ended project: can develop new tech, or  make something more accessible

Broken into four parts
- [Final Project Proposal]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/project-proposals.html) (due Monday)
- [Final Project Checkpoint 1]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/project-checkpoint.html) (due 11/13; Presentations in lab on 11/14, **required attendance**)
- [Final Project Checekpoint 2](same assignment spec as Checkpoint 1) (due 11/25; Presentations in class on 11/25 and 11/27, **required attendance**)
- [Final Project Presentations]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/project-final-presentatinos.html) (in class and possibly lab depending on number of groups, week of 12/2).
- [Final Project Website]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/project-final-handin.html) and [Individual reflection]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/project-final-individual-template.html) (due by end of final exam period, 12/9 11:30am)

---
# Proposal
- Can be individual
- Written format only
- Should be based around a first person account and analyzed with positive disability principals
- Handin is on Canvas AND you post a summary on  [Ed]({{site.discussion}}/5583557)

---
# Checkpoints
- By first checkpoint you should be in groups of 2-4, with people in your section, or who can all attend the same section if needed
- The *whole group* is required to attend checkpoint meetings (some are in section; some in class)
- Checkpoint meetings are with the staff, not in front of the whole class, but should include a brief presentation. 
- Deadlines are *NOT MONDAYS*, they are 24 hrs before your presentations

---
# Final Project Presentations
- These will be in the last week of class
- Length will depend on the number of groups, but we are reserving wednesday and friday lecture and both sections Thursday to be sure

---
# Final Project Handins
- Due by the end of our finals period
- Includes a website and an individual reflection
- Also requires a disability justice analysis and a plain language summary
