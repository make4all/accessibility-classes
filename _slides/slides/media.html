# Typical (on-phone) screen reader interaction

Three core interaction patterns: 

- Swipe to navigate linearly
- Touch to navigate spatially
- The first “hit” of an interface element will focus, double tap to select/activate that interface element

# Building for Accessibility

*Role of Designers/Developers is important here*
- Only they can provide proper ALT text
- Their choices impact navigation order
- They need to announce things that change
- Size and color matter too

## Proper ALT text

What is a good name for the "Like" Button?

Enable the user to understand the name of the control they have navigated to, what type of control it is, what value it has, what state it has.

## Proper ALT text

Screen reader will read out name, role, and state. Don't repeat these.

Good alt text: Name ("Like")

API knows: Role ("Button")

API knows: State ("Not selected")

What focus order makes sense for the Facebook newsfeed? 

Does this match the actual focus order?

When might you need to	*skip* things?

## What order do you think will be used

.right-column60[
Use chunks to group meaningful info and reduce number of navigation steps. 
- User can double tap to drill down into chunk (e.g. navigate to the “like” button by drilling down into an individual post).

Entering the wrong login credentials triggered an error message. If you couldn’t see the UI and the error wasn’t announced, you would have no idea if login succeeded or not.

# Size

Especially hard on mobile devices

.right-column60[
Even if the user misses the Text Label on the screen, they will still be able to trigger the desired action because the touch target is larger than what appears, resulting in less user error.

White space around targets also helps

# Color contrast

Choose colors that provide enough contrast between content and the background so that anyone with low-vision impairments and color deficiencies can perceive the content.

.left-column50[
WCAG Level AAA requires a contrast ratio of at least
- .contrast71[7:1 for normal text] 
- .contrast41[4.5:1 for large text (14t pt bold or larger)] 
- .badcontrast[Avoid anything else!]
]
.right-column50[
- [Colorzilla](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/colorzilla/bhlhnicpbhignbdhedgjhgdocnmhomnp?hl=en) is an excellent tool for extracting the color value from any page element; 
- WebAIM has a [contrast checker](https://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/#:~:text=WCAG%20Level%20AAA%20requires%20a,value%20from%20any%20page%20element)

# Summary and most common errors
 
| |Description  | 
|--|----------------------|
|<i class="darklight fa fa-times-circle fa-2x"></i> | Missing element label ||
|<i class="darklight fa fa-retweet fa-2x"></i>  | Item label ends with type, e.g., “Play Button.” TalkBack automatically announces item type, so information is redundant |
|<i class="darklight fa fa-eye-slash fa-2x"></i>  | UI Change not announced |
|<i class="darklight fa fa-server fa-2x"></i>  | Navigation lacks hierarchy; or makes no sense |
|<i class="darklight fa fa-search-minus fa-2x"></i>  | Item is too small|
|<i class="greylight fa fa-adjust fa-2x"></i>  | Low contrast in image or icon |
|<i class="greylight fa fa-quote-left fa-2x"></i>  | Low text contrast between foreground and background |

# Some additional things to watch out for

| |Description  | 
|--|----------------------|
|<i class="darklight fa fa-strikethrough fa-2x"></i> | TextView has a content description. This might interfere with a screen reader’s ability to read the content of the text field |
|<i class="darklight fa fa-retweet fa-2x"></i>  | Item's role  identical with alt text|
| <i class="darklight fa fa-angle-double-right fa-2x"></i>   | Overlapping clickable items         |
|<i class="darklight fa fa-link fa-2x"></i> | URL in link may be invalid |
