# Accessibility technology 
How people with disabilities *may* navigate computers (and the world)

Used to be called "assistive technology" but that language is ableist

One solution, not parallel solutions


???

Not a *medical* device

A broader view than Wikipedia

# Lots of software for this

.left-column50[
- Magnifier – make whole screen or a portion bigger
  - Can also just use larger fonts, lower resolution
  - Change colors and contrast
- Free Screen Reader – read the words on the screen
- On-Screen keyboard 
  - Can be scanned
- Built-in speech recognition
]
.right-column50[
Most Operating Systems (laptops and smartphones) have  a whole collection of adaptations 

![:img Windows access settings showing magnifier; narrator; on screen keyboard; windows speech recognition ,75%, width](img/accessibility/windows-access.png)]

???
lots of software for this

Adaptations for mouse
- Make mouse easier to see
- Move mouse with the keyboard

Adaptations for keyboard
- Sticky Keys – so no need for chords
- Work like on Smartphones

---
# Example: Single Switch Access  (1/2)

Can point to on-screen keyboards with various mechanisms, or use scanning keyboards
- e.g. sip and puff to select 

On Screen Keyboard
- Usually add auto-complete and *auto-predict*: Predict next word based on previous words with no letters typed

# Design A11yhood
- Emphasizes agency and control
- Provides for flexibility and adaptation
- Supports creativity and hackery
- Focuses on problems that disabled people care about
- Includes diversity

- VoiceOver – reads what is on screen
- Speech recognition for controlling device
- Zoom – screen magnifier – 3 finger tap
- Closed captions on videos
- AssistiveTouch – fewer fingers needed, etc.
- Switch Control (IOS7 and later) [head movement with built in camera](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RXF2ThtYXzM) or external switch

# Who is (Typically) Behind Disability Dongles?

.quote[Thank you for your feedback is a signal that we have no control over how our knowledge will be used; by reframing disabled expertise and critique as “feedback,” this phrase, like IKEA’s ThisAbles campaign, relegates disabled people to the role of user and subordinates disabled knowledge to the (professional) designerly imagination. It’s a disingenuous phrase, in which “thank you” is uttered to remind us that it is actually us who should be grateful.

# A Framework for Intersectional Research

Consider theories drawn from multiple areas of identity
- Language Justice (relating to multilingual access)
- Disability Justice (queer people of color 
- ... [you need to do the work to find the relevant theories]

---
# Example: Disability Justice
Concept developed by Queer, BIPOC disabled people

Deeply connected to anti-capitalist politics.
- You may not agree, but you should be able to explain the principals anyway. 
- We are not defining this, we are learning it. 

Let's analyze this model in a design context using the Bennett paper

# Disability Justice Principles (1/10)

1. INTERSECTIONALITY(*) "we are many things, and they all impact us."

[Sins Invalid](https://www.sinsinvalid.org/) disability based performance project defines [10 principles of disability justice](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5bed3674f8370ad8c02efd9a/t/5f1f0783916d8a179c46126d/1595869064521/10_Principles_of_DJ-2ndEd.pdf) which are:


(*) Feminist theorist Kimberlé Crenshaw coined intersectionality in
1989 to describe the experiences of Black women, who experience both
racism and sexism.

???
“We do not live single issue lives” –Audre Lorde.

Ableism, coupled with white supremacy, supported by capitalism, underscored by heteropatriarchy, has rendered the vast majority of the world “invalid.”



---
# Intersectionality in Design:

Ensure that the things we build address multiple disabled people, with varied identities, and multiple disabled people 

Bennett paper

---
# Disability Justice Principles (2/10)

1. INTERSECTIONALITY "we are many things, and they all impact us."
2. LEADERSHIP OF THOSE MOST IMPACTED helps us stay grounded by those we serve

???
“We are led by those who most know these systems.” –Aurora Levins Morales

lifting up, listening to, reading, following, and highlighting the perspectives of those who are most impacted by the systems we fight against."
by centering the

leadership of those most impacted, we keep ourselves grounded in real-world
problems and find creative strategies for resistance. "

---
# Leadership of those most impacted 

Disability led decisions, not disability dongles. When we design for people with disabilities,
- People with disabilities are part of the design process (or lead it)
- The needs of those MOST impacted among that subset come FIRST, then the majority follows



---
# Disability Justice Principles (3/10)

1. INTERSECTIONALITY "we are many things, and they all impact us."
2. LEADERSHIP OF THOSE MOST IMPACTED helps us stay grounded by those we serve
3. ANTI-CAPITALIST POLITICS "we resist conforming to 'normative' levels
of productivity in a capitalist culture" 

???
In an economy that sees land and humans as components of profit, we are anti-capitalist by the nature of having non-conforming body/minds.

Capitalism depends on wealth accumulation for some (the white ruling class), at the expense of others... Our worth is not dependent on what and how much we can produce.

---
# Anti-Capitalist Politics in Design

When we create systems, we make them accessible even though it may cost time and money
- No segregation, even if it is cheaper to implement 

Maybe antithetical to ALT text?

???
Consider things like disclosure and invisibility

---
# Disability Justice Principles (4/10)

4) CROSS-MOVEMENT SOLIDARITY "Through cross-movement solidarity, we create a united front."

???
disability justice lends itself to politics of alliance.

Align with racial justice, reproductive justice, queer and trans liberation, prison abolition, environmental justice, anti-police terror, Deaf activism, fat liberation, and more... challenging white disability communities around racism and challenging other movements to confront ableism.

---
# Cross-Movement Solidarity in Design

Addressing accessibility isn't enough if we aren't inclusive of other identities 

How does this differ from intersectionality?


---
# Disability Justice Principles (5/10)

4) CROSS-MOVEMENT SOLIDARITY "Through cross-movement solidarity, we create a united front."

5) RECOGNIZING WHOLENESS "Disabled people are whole people."

???
People have inherent worth outside of commodity relations and capitalist notions of productivity. Each person is full of history and life experience.

Each person is full of history and life experience. Each person has an internal
experience composed of our own thoughts, sensations, emotions, sexual fantasies,
perceptions, and quirks. 

---
# Recognizing Wholeness in Design

We should include accessibility in all the spaces that people interact with technology, because people with disabilities exist in all of the spaces -- as authors and consumers; programmers and users; and in every area of life

What addition to the Bennett paper would fulfill this?

---
# Disability Justice Principles (6/10)

4) CROSS-MOVEMENT SOLIDARITY "Through cross-movement solidarity, we create a united front."

5) RECOGNIZING WHOLENESS "Disabled people are whole people."

6) SUSTAINABILITY "pace ourselves, individually and collectively"

???
We pace ourselves, individually and collectively, to be sustained long term. Our embodied experiences guide us toward ongoing justice and liberation.

to be sustained long-term, value the teachings of our bodies and experiences, and use them as a critical guide and reference point to help us move away from urgency and into a deep, slow, transformative, unstoppable wave of justice and liberation.

---
# Sustainability in Design

We should work at a pace that includes everyone in the work, and not value the rush products to market over access


What addition to the Bennett paper would fulfill this?


---
# Disability Justice Principles (7/10)

4) CROSS-MOVEMENT SOLIDARITY "Through cross-movement solidarity, we create a united front."

5) RECOGNIZING WHOLENESS "Disabled people are whole people."

6) SUSTAINABILITY "pace ourselves, individually and collectively"

7) COMMITMENT TO CROSS-DISABILITY SOLIDARITY "isolation undermines collective liberation"

???
even and especially those who are most often left out of political conversations. Break down the isolation between people with physical
impairments, people who are sick or chronically ill, psych survivors and people
with mental health disabilities, neurodiverse people, people with intellectual or
developmental disabilities, Deaf people, Blind people, people with environmental
injuries and chemical sensitivities, and all others who experience ableism and
isolation that undermines our collective liberation.

# Disability Justice Principles (8/10)


8) INTERDEPENDENCE "We work to meet each other's needs" rather than depending on state solutions 

???
 the liberation of all living systems and the land as integral to the liberation of our own communities, as we all share one planet. We work to meet each other’s needs as we build toward liberation, knowing that state solutions inevitably extend into further control over lives.


---
# Disability Justice Principles (9/10)


8) INTERDEPENDENCE "We work to meet each other's needs" rather than depending on state solutions 

9) COLLECTIVE ACCESS "We can share responsibility for our access needs ... balance autonomy while being in community" 

???
AS brown, black and queer-bodied disabled people we bring flexibility and creative nuance that go beyond able-bodied/minded normativity, to be in community with each other.

... Access needs aren’t shameful — we all function differently depending on context and environment. Access needs can be articulated and met privately, through a collective, or in community, depending upon an individual’s needs, desires, and the capacity of the group. We can share responsibility for our access needs, we can ask that our needs be met without compromising our integrity, we can balance autonomy while being in community, we can be unafraid of our vulnerabilities, knowing our strengths are respected. 


---
# Disability Justice Principles (10/10)


8) INTERDEPENDENCE "We work to meet each other's needs" rather than depending on state solutions 

9) COLLECTIVE ACCESS "We can share responsibility for our access needs ... balance autonomy while being in community" 

10) COLLECTIVE LIBERATION  No body or mind can be left behind – only moving together can we accomplish the revolution we require.

???
We move together as people with mixed abilities, multiracial, multi-gendered, mixed class, across the sexual spectrum, with a vision that leaves no bodymind behind.

# A note on ableist language

- [Should I say 'disabled people'](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3517428.3544813) 

]

.right-column[
Identity-first language (“disabled people”) vs. people-first (“people with disabilities”). Preferences change depending on region, cultural context, community

Avoid “stricken with”, “suffers from” or victimization language

Avoid “able-bodied” or “normal” as differentiating terms

---
# Application of Positive Disability Principals to Research Competency

- Is it ableist?
- What parts of it are accessible?  (for example, are both design tools, and their outputs accessible?)
- Are people with disabilities engaged in guiding this work? At what stages?
- Does it give control and improve agency for people with disabilities
- Is it addressing the whole community (intersectionality, multiple disabled people, multiply disabled people)

???
You should be able to summarize and critique accessibility research, including your own, on the following concerns:

You will be assessed on this based on things like paper summaries and based on your writeup of your final project, as well as our assessment of how well your final project embodies these goals.



---
# Disability Model Analysis Competency

We want you to demonstrate an ability to argue for how a given technology or research project, including your own, meets or fails to meet appropriate disability principles drawn from 
- disability studies’ models of disability, 
- disability justice’s 10 principles laid out by Sins Invalid, 
- Liz Jackson’s concept of a disability dongle
- and so on.
