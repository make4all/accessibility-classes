[//]: # (Outline Slide)
# Learning Goals for Today 

- **Building for Accessibility**
  - We will focus on screen readers 
  - And understanding structure in interactive apps
  - And how this impacts user agents (such as screen readers)
- Assignment

---
# (On-desktop) screen reader interaction
Three core  interaction patterns:
- Linear navigation through like objects
- Hierarchical navigation through logically related objects
- Switching between object types

---
# (On-phone) screen reader interaction

.left-column[
![:img screen reader by Sophia Bai from the Noun Project, 100%, width](img/assessment/screenreader.png)
]
.right-column[
Three core interaction patterns: 

- Swipe to navigate linearly
- Touch to navigate spatially
- The first “hit” of an interface element will focus, double tap to select/activate that interface element

Discuss similarities and differences from desktop

# Lifecycle of a browser loading a page

.left-column40[
1. Fetch the page
2. Parse the page
3. Build up an internal representation of the web page [structure]
4. Display the page [style]
5. Handle interaction [behavior]
]

# Parse and Display the Page

.left-column[
![:img Initial screen for the spot the heron app, 90%,width](img/building/spottheheronscreen.png)

]

.right-column[
1. First line: <!DOCTYPE html>
   -  OK: need to build an internal representation of the page
2. Line-by-line, go through the HTML
   - If one of the tags links to a cascading style sheet (CSS) file, load and parse it
   - If one of the tags links to JavaScript (JS) for behavior, load and parse it
3. FINALLY display the page…

# Understanding content

.column-90[
- There are 100s of possible HTML tags! See [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)!
- Some simple tags
  - Title ```<title></title>``` (which nests inside your ```<head></head>```)
  - Headings ```<h1></h1>``` .. ```<h6></h6>```
  - Paragraphs ```<p>```
  - Ordered or unordered lists: ```<ol></ol>```, ```<ul></ul>```, with list elements ```<li></li>```
  - Horizontal rules ```<hr />```
  - Strong ```<strong></strong>``` which defaults to a bold style and emphasis ```<em></em>``` which defaults to italicized in most browsers.

# Adding content

- There are 100s of tags! See [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)!
- Some simple tags
- Some tags add semantic context
  - `<header></header>`: The header or banner that displays the title of the page
  - `<main></main>`: The bulk of the content of the page
  - `<footer></footer>`: The footer is optional but you can put contact info and copyright date in there.

---
# Adding content

- There are 100s of tags! See [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element)!
- Some simple tags
- Some tags add semantic context
- Some tags need additional information, added to a tag with attributes
  - Links to other pages `<a href="filename"></a>`
  - Links to images `<img src="img.jpg" alt="Description!"/>`

- Some tags (comments) are important for documentation `<!-- -->`


---
# Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

- Allows us to change the look and feel of the content on the page
- Style is separated into a .css file
  - Makes styling multiple pages easier
  - Allows changing multiple pages easier
- Style sheets must be linked to an html page in the <head> for the styles to work
     `<link href=“style.css” rel=“stylesheet” />`
- Great example is [CSS Zen Garden](http://www.csszengarden.com/)

# Document Object Model (DOM) (1/3)

.left-column[
![:img Initial screen for the spot the heron app, 90%,width](img/building/spottheheronscreen.png)
]

.right-column[
- We must build up a hierarchy of document elements (the **Document Object Model**)
- The structure of this depends on our HTML (or the toolkit that generates your HTML or App)
- The structure of this influences layout

# How do we make it more interactive?


How about we add a button?

count: false


Wait? When you hear the word "button" in the context of a graphical user
interface (GUI), what do you think of?

---
# What should it do?

What do we tell the toolkit about the button?
- Where to place it
- How it should react to user input (from which device?)

# This week's assignment
The goal of this homework is to make something more accessible (e.g. website, visualization, user interface, AR/VR, etc) that you’ve already made.

Required learning goals: 
- Accessible Document Creation
- Familiarity with a Range of Accessibility Technologies
- Image Description

???
If you don't have an interface, come speak with us!
