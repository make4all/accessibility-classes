# Why Plain Language

Helps make text accessible to the non-scientific public (including disabled people). 

Can also directly help someone with an intellectual disability. 
- [WCAG guidelines](https://www.w3.org/WAI/GL/WCAG3/2021/how-tos/clear-words/) state that text simplification also "benefit individuals who live with cognitive and learning disabilities, language impairments, memory impairments, and autism." 

--
Somewhat different requirements for these different audiences

---
# When to use Plain Language

- May help with member checking (make sure that study participants or other interested parties can learn about your research)
- Responsibility to share research you do *on* disabled people *with* disabled people (i.e. back to the public)
- The  Plain Writing Act of 2010, described on [plainlanguage.gov](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/law/), "requires federal agencies use clear government communication that the public can understand and use."
- Meets WCAG AAA standard ([SC 3.1.5](https://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/meaning-supplements.html)) 

---
# When Not to use Plain Language

- Scientific paper submissions benefit from clear and concise and readable text, but this is different from text simplification
- WCAG AAA is a very high standard to meet everywhere

# Text Simplification Guidelines 
We are asking you to focus on this subset

.left-column50[
- Use simple words
- Use positive language

- Avoid jargon
]

- Use present tense
- Use examples

]

---

# Use Simple Words
- <q>as a means of</q>  &rarr;  <q>to</q>
- <q>at the present time</q>  &rarr; <q>now</q>

---

# Use Positive Language
- Avoid double negatives
- <q>no fewer than</q> &rarr; <q>at least</q>

---
# Example of double negations 

From [NIU](https://www.niu.edu/writingtutorial/grammar/double-negatives.shtml)

- "There is no way I cannot visit my mother this year."
- **Alternative** "I must visit my mother."

- "I miss not seeing him every day."
- **Alternative** "I miss seeing him every day"

---
# You try it: 

- "I wasn't unhappy with my grade." 

--

- **Alternative** "I was lukewarm about my grade."

--

- "The shopper did not have any energy left at the end of the day."
--

- **Alternative** "The shopper had no energy left at the end of the day."

---

# Use Short Paragraphs and Sentences
- Consider if a clause should become a new sentence

---

# Avoid Jargon
- Sometimes the complex word isn't necessary
- If you must use jargon, define it

---

# Use Active Voice
- <q>The lake was polluted by the company</q> &rarr;  <q>The company polluted the lake</q>
- A good check to see if you're using passive voice: are you using
	- A form of <q>to be</q> (e.g., am, is, are, was, be, being, been)
	- A verb ending in <q>-ed</q>

---
# QUICK BREAK

Good time to stand and stretch
---

# Use Present Tense
- Don't: <q>These sections describe types of information that would satisfy the application requirements of Circular A-110 as it would apply to this grant program.</q>
- Do: <q>These sections tell you how to meet the requirements of Circular A-110 for this grant program.</q>

---

# Use Examples
- Especially for more complicated topics


---

# Use Transition Words
- Use words: <q>for instance,</q> <q>also,</q> <q>however,</q> <q>to summarize</q>
- Echo previous ideas
- Avoid ambiguous <q>this</q>


---

# Use Headers
- Preferably, use headers that are built into platforms (e.g., Google Docs, Microsoft Word, EdStem)
- If those are not available, styling text in bold or underlined can still help visual readers

---

# Text Simplification Resources
- If you have any questions or want examples about any of these concepts, you can look at the [PlainLanguage.gov website](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/guidelines/).
