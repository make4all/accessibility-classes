- If you did not contribute at all to a given competency, we will not assess you on it.

- You should try to contribute on competencies that you need further work on or have only done once.

- You can also include information about additional competencies, such as UARs and a reflection stating what app or website you were assessing, which tasks you were assessing, and which AT and/or automated tools you used to generate the UARS
