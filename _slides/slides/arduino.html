## Make sure zoom is running and recording!!!
## Check on zoom buddies
## Make sure captioning is turned on

[//]: # (Outline Slide)
# Learning Goals for today

# In-class build exercise…


We will make something blink!!

# Preparation

Distribute Arduinos and parts…

If you haven’t downloaded and installed the Arduino IDE, drivers (for Macs only), do that now while we are getting parts distributed. See the  AdaFruit website BlueFruit page
If you are on a mac, you will additionally need to install the USB to UART bridge drivers provided by Silabs
By Wednesday you will also need the Bluefruit LE Connect app, and here is the AdaFruit website describing how to install that

Your circuitry kits are from amazon: https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B01EROKLBC

# Solderless Breadboard

.left-column[
![:img A picture of a breadboard, 100%, width](img/physical/breadboard.png)

.right-column[
Allows you to quickly make electrical connections by pressing wires into holes

# Solderless Breadboard

.left-column[
![:img A picture of a breadboard with wires acrsoss rows, 100%, width](img/physical/breadboard2.png)

]
.right-column[
Allows you to quickly make electrical connections by pressing wires into holes

Central rows of holes are connected like this
```
A1 is connected to 
B1, C1, D1, and E1
F1 is connected to 
G1, H1, I1 and J1
Etc. for rows 2…63
```

# Solderless Breadboard

.left-column[
![:img A picture of a breadboard with wires down power and ground, 100%, width](img/physical/breadboard3.png)

]
.right-column[
Allows you to quickly make electrical connections by pressing wires into holes

Side columns (‘bus’) (typically for power) are connected like this

# Step 1: Connect Power Bus Sides

.left-column[
![:img A picture of a breadboard with the two sides of power and ground connected, 100%, width](img/physical/breadboard4.png)

]
.right-column[
Connect Red to Red and Blue to Blue at the bottom (using red & black wires from kit)

Double check that it’s Red to Red and Blue to Blue (!)
]

---
# Step 2: Arduino into breadboard

.left-column[
![:img A picture of a breadboard with arduino added, 100%, width](img/physical/breadboard5.png)

]
.right-column[
Arduino is about in the center of the breadboard (just to the left) at low numbered end, with USB connecter towards the outside (top)

Check: You should see “a b”  and  “j”  at the top and pins in rows 1…16
]

---
# Test

Plug the USB cable between computer and Arduino

Should see a bright blue or green (power) LED
 on constantly, indicating we are powered
and red LED should flash once per second
a “blink” test program already loaded (will be replaced)

Side note: Computer should recognize device
May need to install drivers if you haven’t already (Macs). Not necessary today.

# Step 2: Power from Arduino

.left-column[
![:img A picture of a breadboard with power circled, 100%, width](img/physical/breadboard6.png)

]
.right-column[
For this project, USB is powering Arduino, Arduino is powering the rest of the circuit

Connect Arduino GND pin
]
---
# Step 3a: Power from Arduino

.left-column[
![:img A picture of a breadboard with a wire from a4 to ground, 100%, width](img/physical/breadboard7.png)

]
.right-column[
For this project, USB is powering Arduino, Arduino is powering the rest of the circuit

Connect Arduino GND pin

Can do this from a4 because breadboard ground pin is plugged into row 4
]

---
# Step 3b: Power from Arduino

.left-column[
![:img A picture of a breadboard with a wire from a2 to power, 100%, width](img/physical/breadboard8.png)

]
.right-column[
Now connect Arduino 3V to power using a red wire (A2 to power bus)

At this point, power and ground are connected in both buses. All further wiring will take place in the f-j columns if not specified.

# Note


This part of the wiring will be used for the rest of your projects in this class, so leave it in place after you are done with this build
