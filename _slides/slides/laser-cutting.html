dating back to the 1890s, it's the work of a German seamstress who had been consigned to an asylum. Although it's often falsely described as her straitjacket, it was actually cut and assembled from a hospital gown, tailored and then turned into an autobiography wrought on fabric.

# What is craft?

- 1000s of years old
- Highly skilled
- Only labeled “arts and crafts” after the industrial revolution
- Often centered in women’s “busy” work
- Sometimes entrepreneurial 
- Exceptional at addressing unique and individual needs

# How Laser Cutting works

<div class="mermaid">
graph LR

class A,B,D blue

</div>


We're using a [Glowforge](https://glowforge.com/). 
- It takes SVGs as input
- It can engrave, cut, etc
- We're providing plywood, 3mm thick [double check with calipers]
- We will not engrave during lab, it slows things down too much, but we may cut

---
# What can you do?

.left-column40[
![:img Illustration of cutting scoring and engraving first with those words and then with stars. Cutting cuts a hole; Scoring outlines something; and Engraving burns it into the wood, 70%, width](img/3dprinting/laser-Cut-Score-Engrave.png)
]
.right-column60[
Cutting: Makes a hole

Scoring: Doesn't cut all the way through. Use a different color

Engraving: Burns. Can do greyscale.
- Images.  Make sure they're not too dark. 
- Add in a drawing program after Tinkercad
]

---
# How we will create SVGS

First create a design in TinkerCAD (or other CAD software if you know it well)
- You should group everything together that is touching
- Place it carefully. The base plane will determine what is part of the final SVG
- We will not engrave during lab, it slows things down too much, but we may cut
- Export it as SVG (demo)
   - Include mm as units

---

# Your process

1. Measure your object
2. Make an svg of your design
3. Print it on paper
4. Cut it out and check your measurements AGAIN
5. Iterate
6. Upload it to our drive
7. Sand, glue & paint (if you want)

# Example: My bag holder

# First print: On Paper

# Measuring

.left-column50[![:img Calipers stretch the width of four fingers and show a measurement of about 76mm , 100%, width](img/3dprinting/measuring.jpg)
]

---
# Other Important Measurements

The amount of wood removed by the laser cutter as it burns through the wood.

Should always test for each new type of wood and wood thickness

[Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/How-to-Adjust-for-Wood-Thickness-and-Kerf-on-a-Las/) on how to do this

Only an issue if you're making a box or something else that has to assemble

Use calipers to measure!

# Next class

Come prepared to design: 
[TinkerCad](https://www.tinkercad.com/dashboard)

[Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator.html). Best for most tasks if you have it

[AutoCAD](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) (free for students). Probably overkill

[Inkscape](https://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview?term=1-YEAR&tab=subscription) (free). Best free option

Can even use powerpoint

---
# Now: time to start your design

(Pen and paper first)
