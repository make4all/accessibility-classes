# POUR: Operable: Guidelines 2.1-2.5

.left-column[
## Guideline 2.1 (1/5)
Keyboard Accessible
]
.right-column[

Keyboards are uniquely flexible & pretty universal 

Keyboards are operable  by people with most disabilities

Examples of who benefits
- screen reader users (e.g. blind users, reading disabilities)
- speech input users
- switch input users

## Guideline 2.1 (3/5)
Keyboard Accessible

Some common pitfalls:

- Keyboard Traps. 
  - "Trap" keyboard focus within areas of a page
  - Occurs when multiple formats are combined  using plug-ins/embedded applications.

Problem if you are using tab to navigate (for example)

.left-column[
## Guideline 2.1 (5/5) 
Keyboard Accessible
]
.right-column[
Some common pitfalls:

- Keyboard Traps.
- Invisible Content. Some parts of a web page can never be reached
- Lack of Control. Users should be able to reconfigure or remove shortcuts
]

???
Note: Not in guidelines (that I know of) but a "reverse trap" is whether you can reach text that *doesn't* have links or headers when using switch input. How would you do this?

Character key shortcuts work well for many keyboard users, but are inappropriate and frustrating for speech input users — whose means of input is strings of letters — and for keyboard users who are prone to accidentally hit keys. To rectify this issue, authors need to allow users to turn off or reconfigure shortcuts that are made up of only character keys.

# POUR: Operable: Guidelines 2.1-2.5

.left-column[

Enough Time
]
.right-column[
Timed content includes rotating content; timeouts; etc

Many users who have disabilities may need more time to complete tasks
- To physically respond
- To read things
- To find things (e.g. due to low vision)
- To accessing content through an assistive technology (e.g. single switch)

   - Able to resume after timeout without data loss
- Warn users about time limits
- Provide controls (Pause, Stop & Hide) for blinking text and animations 
- Let users postpone or suppress interruptions 
- Interruptions involving an emergency still appear (AAA)

Seizures and Physical Reactions
]
.right-column[
In 1997, a cartoon on television in Japan sent over 700 children to the hospital, including about 500 who had seizures.
 - Most people are unaware that they are triggered until it strikes. 
 - Warnings do not work well because they are often missed, especially by children who may in fact not be able to read them.
