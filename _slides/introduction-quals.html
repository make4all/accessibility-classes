**1980**
![:img picture of a person,40%, width](img/intro/1980.png)

**Disability as a personal attribute**
"restriction or lack of ability ... within the range considered normal" 

Is a **medical model** asking how do we *fix people*

]

.left-column50[
**1990s**
![:img picture of a network of people,32%, width](img/intro/today.png) 

**Disability in context**
 "the interaction between features of a person's body and ... [their] society"
 
 Is a **social model** asking how do we *fix society*
]

---
# Neither is quite right

- Medical Model  (how do we *fix people*) 
- Social Model (how do we *fix society*)

Postmodern: Disability doesn't need to be fixed, but celebrated as part of human variation. Disability pride, disability culture, and disabled joy are all things to support and celebrate.

call out that you don't have to be famous to be proud of being disabled

call out multiple disabilities

---
# Rates of Disability are increasing

Rates of disability are increasing
- Aging population
- Long COVID
- Increasing numbers of people with chronic illness (can span disability segments)
Not everyone in these groups identifies as disabled

---
# Don't oversimplify
- People can be multiply disabled
- More than one disabled person might be in the same space with different accommodations 


---

# Accommodation

Accommodation is your right
- Co-producing access for all participants in a space or event
- Sometimes helped by software & media, some [free](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/technology/) 
- Legally mandated, but also so much more
- Mandated by multiple laws in Higher Education (That is why UW has a DRS office)
- Ongoing and constant legal challenges, especially to the [ADA](http://www.webaim.org/coordination/law/us/ada)
- In addition, 147 countries have ratified the **UN Convention on Rights of PD** (2006)

???
1996 ADA complaint against San José
Use of PDF inaccessible to city commissioner 
Web sites are a “service” and thus subject to the ADA
Led to S. J. Web Page Disability Access Standard
1999 Natn’l Fed. of the Blind against AOL
Based on the interpretation of the Web as a place of public accommodation (ADA)
Settled out of court
2000: AOL agreed to make its browser accessible
Many others (http://www.webaim.org/coordination/law/us/ada)

---
# Some US laws 
- **Individuals with Disabilities Education Act** (IDEA, 1975): Free appropriate public education in the least restrictive environment to every child with a disability.
- Section 503 of the **Rehab Act** (1973): Equal access to government services
- **Americans with Disabilities Act** (1990): Equal access to all goods/services

---
#  How is this class accessible? (1/3)

Many disabilities benefit from flexibility in how time is spent

--

In our class this means: 
- We have tried to structure the class to support you ( For example, you have up to two late days *per assignment* for assignment completion, no questions asked).
- If you need further accommodations
for any reason, talk to us and consider working with
[DRS](https://depts.washington.edu/uwdrs/) as well.

---
#  How is this class accessible? (2/3)

Sometimes students with disabilities, such as chronic illness or mental health concerns (which are both very common disabilities among  college students) may need to participate in class remotely. 

**Also** some disabled students may be at high risk for COVID, and should not have to worry that attending class could cause them to become ill.

---
# In our class, this means:
- We provide for hybrid participation
- We provide masks and encourage masking in person
- We attend class remotely if we have cold, flu, or suspected COVID symptoms

---
#  How is this class Hybrid?

**Attendance is expected**, by everyone in the class.

However we allow remote participation *and work to ensure* that students who cannot do that, or are high risk, to have an equal experience. 

**Remote attendance is expected** if:
- You have cold or flu symptoms or suspect you have COVID
- You have care giving / family obligations that affect class or your commute to class
- You have mental health concerns or any accessibility needs that are best met by being remote 

**Use your "complete misses" wisely** e.g. You are traveling to CHI
   
---
# How do I participate remotely?

0. You find a zoom buddy 
1. You *attend via Zoom* with the help of your zoom buddy
2. You *contribute a discussion post to every small group discussion* linked to in the [class schedule/slides]({{site.baseurl}}/schedule)
3. You fill out the *remote participation survey* portion of the [class participation survey](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1665828/assignments/8443511) 

If you cannot attend live or synchronously by Zoom, participation means watching the recording and doing (2) and (3) above 

---
#  How is this class accessible? (3/3)

We commit to mutually working together to make it accessible. 
- DRS approval is required for some accommodations (specifically, those that are not available to the entire class)
- But many accommodations benefit most students. This is a form of *disability justice* because access to disability documentation and comfort with disclosure are both things that are inequitably distributed

--

In our class, this means that where possible, we provide those as a standard part of the class. To that end...

# Small Group Discussion

How would you implement this in your lab or workplace? (post on our [Discussion Board]({{site.discussion}}))

---
# Other Important Facts about this Class

- **Sharing**: Yes, but don't copy
- **Plagiarism**: No
- **Language**:  I am Jen (preferred), or Dr. Mankoff or Prof. Mankoff
- **Respect**: This class is a compact between us based on respect
- **Inclusivity**: An important value in this class, and in HCI!

---
# A little more on inclusivity

Inclusivity does not (and should not) require disclosure, this goes for accessibility and ANYTHING else

How  can you ask for help without violating privacy or boundaries? I won't make you justify your requests for help or accommodations or pry into your life.

I'm happy to talk about my disability anytime though.

???
[not yet true] Especially because Biden's new Title IX regulations make me a mandatory reporter. 

This is the most important thing I’m going to talk about today. Have I got everyone’s attention? You can’t miss this part

---
# A Note on Academic Integrity

Don't plagiarize. If you use someone else's text, quote them and reference them. 

In addition to being expected based on UW policy, this is a form of [*Citational Justice*](nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00793-1)
 and thus an important expression of disability justice values in our class. Therefore
- If you plagiarize you will receive a 0 on participation for that assignment
- If you plagiarize on any assignment, you will receive a non-competent on your disability justice competency 

---
# More on Academic Integrity
See our [Academic Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/academic-conduct) page for more details

GAI rules ([Academic Conduct]({{site.baseurl}}/academic-conduct.html#generative-ai))

---
# Grading

Assignment completion and participation is required. This is 15% of your grade. 

We will consider the whole student in assigning this grade and cannot give you a definitive formula

We take your input on this: Participation is a space where you get to choose what works best for you. 

---
# Assignments & Participation

Some things we look at
  - Did you turn in your assignments on time / show reasonable effort on them
  - Assignment completion considers whether you did everything, not how well you did it.
  - Includes asking questions in class (self reported)
  - Participating in discussion and exercises (self reported)
  - Participation in discussion outside of class (based on submissions to Ed)

---
# Competencies
Competencies are 85% of your grade

We use *competency based grading* because it prioritizes *accessibility* and *justice* and *flexibility* for students.

---
# What is competency-based grading?
**Traditional grading** focuses on completion of required tasks

| 85% projects |  15% participation |
|--|--|
| .red[project 1] | .red[class attendance] |
| project 2 | asking question in class |
| ... | ...|


---
# What is competency-based grading?
**Competency-based grading** focuses on evidence of progress and learning

| learning goal 1 | learning goal 2 | learning goal 3 |
|--|--|
| .red[Evidence: Project 1] | Evidence: Project 1 | Evidence: Project 2 | 
| .red[Evidence: Project 2] | Evidence: Project 3 | Evidence: Project 4 | 
| .red[Evidence: Project 4] |  |  | 
| .red[Evidence: Discussion posts] |  | Evidence: Discussion posts |
| ... | ... | ...|


Teaching and learning are centered around *learning outcomes*. This changes how we plan, assess and grade the course.

---
# More detail on competencies (1/2)

- Competencies are the core learning goals in this class. 
- If you learn them all well, you will do well in the class
- You will have multiple opportunities to show us you learned them

You can find all of the competencies under "[Outcomes](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1619674/outcomes)" on canvas

---
# How Competencies Translate to Grades
On any competency, you may be rated as below competent, competent or excellent. 
- There are 10 competencies total
- Your base grade is: Base Grade = Number of Competents/3 + Number of Excellents/2.5
- That grade is **reduced* when you are below competent on more than one competencies as follows: Grade = Base grade - (Number of non competents/3)

You can find all of the competencies under "[Outcomes]({{site.canvas}}/outcomes)" on canvas

---
# How Competencies Translate to a 4.0 scale
On any competency, you may be rated as below competent, competent or excellent

Base grade: Number of Competents/2.5 + Number of Excellents/2
Final grade: Base grade - (Number of non competents/2)

Again, this is 85% of your total grade

---
# Expectations for Ongoing Work

We generally expect you will to achieve competency by the second time you try something, and continue improving to excellence over the quarter. 
- If you achieve excellence, and then stop doing a thing (such as providing alt text), your score may drop. 
- Similarly, if you don't try to do something until the very end of the quarter, even if you do it really well, we may not rate you as highly on that competency. 

---
# Access is also for the teaching staff

One additional note: Once you learn how to make the course more accessible to the teaching staff, we expect accessible documents for grading (e.g. you should always provide ALT text for your images and captioned videos).

---
# Example of Student  Competency  (1/2)


- The presentation slide deck and your first homework are mostly accessible, however you forget to describe any images. As a result, you score "Not Competent" on image descriptions.

--
- On your next assignment you take special care with image descriptions. You are marked "Competent" but the TA has some advice on how to be write more specific and useful descriptions

---
# Example of Student  Competency (2/2)

- You want to finish this, so the next time you include an image in a discussion post, you make sure to describe this, and ask the TA to review it. You followed their advice and you are marked "Excellent"

--
- Over the rest of the quarter, you continue to describe all your images, and maintain "Excellent" in this competency


---

# Example 1: AAC (who uses AAC?)

Kit Autie is an AAC user and YouTube Creator.
The video on the next slide shows the variety of options available over specific strengths
Kit Autie also [describes why they use AAC and  ableist reactions they get when using it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3YQ9F4SFAQ)

Limitations: "*Languaging*" is a multi-person activity in which people can co-create access (or create ableism around access)

Costs have come way down!! (free with in-app purchases)

---
# Example 1 Video

![:youtube A first person account of how Kit Autie uses AAC to communicate  with a few different types of AAC, Tp6YqFz-Ylo]

---
# Not a first person account (1)

![:youtube A mom describes how she is teaching her child to communicate using  AAC at mealtimes, 9FzbX1z-JAM]

Why is this not a first person account? 
- The AAC user never addresses the audience
- The  AAC user never comments on the experience of using it


---
# Not a first person account (2)
![:youtube An advertisement for the Tobii Dynavox, tYgMfL-CnGo]

Why is this not a first person account? 
- It is highly scripted
- It doesn't really review the device at hand

---
# Borderline

![:youtube A first person account of reasons and factors using audible crosswalks, xPlsYhU1HBU?si=jiklQmTbCUQHRcNI&amp;start=126]

- City-produced video with first person account (see 2:10)
  - Limitations: Not universally available; Does not support DeafBlind 
- Designed for people with visual impairments to cross the street

---
# Competencies for [AT Around Us]({{site.baseurl}}/assignments/finding-accessibility.html)
