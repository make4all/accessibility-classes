Reminder: turn in 
Turn in your report document. Note: do not submit a PDF. We expect your submission to be a Word or Google Doc. 
   - Also turn in (individually) a description of what you contributed to the report. This will impact which competencies we grade you on. 
   - It is fine if more than one person works on the same thing, but describe how: For example, if one person made the report accessible, and a second person double checked it, tell us what role you played.

- HW3 Assessment: Pay attention to more detail on your accessibility fixes; we'll release grades as soon as we can

- next week: Fabrication Week!
