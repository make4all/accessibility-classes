# Learning Goals for today
- How might we want to evaluate *any* advanced technology from an accessibility perspective
- Upcoming Technology Review Assignment
- How can AR/VR improve accessibility (guest speaker)

# How might we evaluate *any* advanced technology

Are things made with that technology accessible 

- How is accessibility supported in the building of apps with that technology
- Does this technology depend on secondary things (such as data sets) that may not be accessible/inclusive? 
- Does this technology have societal implications or risks that impact access?
- How can accessibility be assessed

Are people with disabilities able to build apps with this technology

- Are programming tools and so on accessible

Can this technology be used to make new accessibility solutions?

# Case study (1 of 3)
Let's consider the workshop paper on AI Systems that Augment Sensory Abilities

What does it say about making AR/VR apps accessible?
- Does not directly address accessibility of AR/VR apps
- Sensory augmentation may be a "secondary" technology used in AR/VR, in which case accessibility of models (and data they are based on) is highly relevant
- Privacy analysis directly relevant to AR/VR (they discuss head mounted displays)
- Does not directly address assessment of AR/VR accessibility

# Case study (2 of 3)
Let's consider the workshop paper on AI Systems that Augment Sensory Abilities

What does it say about making the creation of AR/VR apps accessible?
- It discusses the fact that inaccessible models can make personalization difficult
- It discusses making model training more accessible

# Case study (3 of 3)
Let's consider the workshop paper on AI Systems that Augment Sensory Abilities

Can this technology be used to make new accessibility solutions?
- Not a focus of the article
- Definitely something we'll talk about later today with our guest speaker, Xia

---
# Second case study (1 of 2)
Survey paper on handheld AR

Are things made with that technology accessible?
- In the building of apps with that technology
- In secondary things it depends on 
- Societal implications
- Assessment practices

Does it address creation of AR/VR by people with disabilities? 

Can this technology be used to make new accessibility solutions?

Form small groups; discuss; [post on Ed](https://edstem.org/us/courses/31170/discussion/2449907)

# Second case study (2 of 2)
My Answers
- Does not really discuss the underlying toolkits that enable accessibility 
- But it does discuss how apps implement accessibility 
  - Interaction techniques (a sort of conceptual tool). Table 3 lays out a broad range of these that have been experimented with in different surveyed papers
  - Specific techniques used to achieve POUR (Table 4) and which surveyed papers they are used in
- Does not discuss secondary things that it might rely on
- Does not really address societal implications
- Talks about evaluation methods used in surveyed papers
  - Survey focused on research literature. All papers used UX Evaluation techniques
  - Does not discuss automated tools or whether they exist

Does it address creation of AR/VR by people with disabilities? No

Can this technology be used to make new accessibility solutions? No

# Learning Goals for today
- How might we want to evaluate *any* advanced technology from an accessibility perspective
- **Upcoming Technology Review Assignment**
- How can AR/VR improve accessibility (guest speaker)

# Technology Review (1 of 2)

Assignment is due in one week

Slightly different from the exercise we just did
- Write plain language summary of one academic article 
- Also summarize of *examples available now* that someone interested in this technology can go try

---
# Technology Review (2 of 2)

Some important notes
- It is OK to leave things out, you should emphasize what will be relevant to a lay audience
   - For example in summarizing the AR/VR survey paper, you might focus on summarizing common approaches used by apps that are accessible to different kinds of disabilities (Tables 3 and 4)
- It is also OK to draw from more than one paper if that is helpful
- We have provided example technologies and articles; but you can pick your own articles, or even technology, *with instructor approval*
