[//]: # (Outline Slide)

- Learning goals
  - Broader perspective on laser cutting, 3D printing and machine knitting
  - Other types of accessible fabrication (e.g. toy adaptation)
  - Talk about the value of additive manufacturing & physical computing in accessibility
  - Cover some common approaches to making & physical computing

Crafters with Disabilities

# Example: Knitters with disabilities

We interviewed 16 disabled knitters about their motivations, process, needs, and experiences of bias

- 11 Blind or Low-Vision
- 7 Motor-impaired
- 3 with Cognitive Impairment

We collected data from six forums to extend our sample size and complement our interviews with more motor and cognition related data

---
# Making Patterns Accessible 

Pattern accessibility was a frequent problem for disabled knitters
- Forum posters mentioned over 40 different pattern formatting guidelines to make patterns more accessible
- Not just about nonvisual access

For example P14-MC, who wrote out patterns in detail, said: 

.quote[...if it says you need to go and knit 16 rows, I’ll write out [all of them] and then I’ll mark them off as I go. (P14-MC)] 

.footnote[MC indicates motor and cognitive impairment]

---
# Making Craft Accessible

Four participants (P1-MVC, P2-V, P5-M, P11-V) reported difficulty with small gauged looms

Both circular knitting needle and loom knitters experienced difficulty executing a purl stitch

.quote[...when I purl …[I] have to push my thumb down like that to get
tension… And so there’s a lot more pinching for me… and that
definitely causes discomfort the fastest. (P3-M)]

.right-column[
The results of knitting solved accessibility problems for some knitters
- Patterns for toy robots with disabilities to increase the inclusion and representation of disability in the knitting community (P10-M)
- Tops for wheelchair users with a shorter back and longer front

.quote[if your sweater is too long in the back [and] goes underneath you, it's hard to transfer. (P14-M)] 

]
---
# Community Ableism

Participants primarily participated in communities of knitters to learn, as support networks, project collaborators, and to increase inclusion. 

Bias included assumptions about ability and even concerns about image, such as one forum poster experienced when a pattern designer *“didn’t like the idea of a wheelchair being in the shot.”*

# Fabrication technologies are not

- ...the Star Trek replicator
- ...as fast as the best manufacturing solutions for bulk manufacturing
- ...as fast as your 2d printer
- ...inexpensive
- ...nice to touch (material range is limited)

**But** they can do a lot of interesting things

# Additive Vs Subtractive

- Additive printing puts down material, building up the object layer by layer
  - Some are done with extruded plastic or other material
  - Others are done with powders that are sealed together (powder printers)
- Subtractive removes materials from around the object

 By clicking the “start” button (b) the application runs and several
  tabs can be selected (c). The “Procedure” box (d) provide to the
  user the instructions to perform the assay, then the Begin button
  allow to proceed to the “Checklist” box (e) where preset timers
  guide the user through the correct incubation times before BL image
  acquisition. The instructions can be also eluded by selecting “Test
  sample” in the home page, which jumps the user directly to the
  checklist. At the end of the countdown the smartphone camera is
  activated and the user can simply touch the “Acquire” button to
  capture the BL image of both the test and control wells. (f) The
  acquired images are rapidly analyzed on the smartphone and the
  sample toxicity result is displayed as “Cell viability” value and a
  warning message (Safe, Harmful, Highly toxic). BL image and results
  can be also saved for downstream application (i.e. sending results
  to a central laboratory).
