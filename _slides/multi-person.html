# Study of End User Content Creation

Although guidelines for tools and for authorship exist, inaccessible
content is still created. 

- How do communities react
- How could authoring tools help this?

.quote[I wasn't able to read your entire post.

Maybe you could go back and break up your paragraphs so they are easier to read?]

???
This quote is taken from a study investigating communities that take an active role in fostering a culture of accessibility, using both formal and informal practices of moderating inaccessible content.

# Case Study 1: Wikipedia

Sample size: 179 discussions, 82 contributors

Of 82, 10 “moderators” – declared members

Qualitative analysis (coding  themes)

---
# What Accessibility Process does Wikipedia Have?
Formal discussion of policy such as Manual of Style

Process of feedback / moderation

.quote[[Marking articles as accessible] would be as if people went and marked templates as ‘This is an article with a Neutral POV’ and ‘This is an article that is well referenced’]

# Key Activity: Moderation

When moderating content accessibility, a moderator provides advice, guidance, or critique relating to an author’s content through
- Talk pages
- Flags 

---
# Key Activity: Moderation

Authority is important for moderators, because sometimes authors did not want to comply with moderator requests.

Moderators sometimes idealized the process

.quote[It isn’t that hard to make sure a page is accessible - just use conventional formatting and heading standards -- M2] 

---
# Key Activity: Moderation

In reality, moderators and authors spent significant time on tensions
between accessibility goals and other editing goals. For example,
- Remove valued moving images
- Increase markup (in violation of another
Wikipedia policy)
- Change page titles (affecting google search
results). 

Additionally, some authors simply disagreed with or reverted
changes made by moderators.

???
- Is an animation a distraction or useful?
- Is it OK to use the Pi symbol π
- Semantic versus visual formatting: End user content creation tools limit changes to header formatting, pushing authors to do more visual formatting

# Key Activity: Advocacy

.quote[I could be [an author advocate] but what exactly would I say? "Don’t ban this person, they have [disability]."? That might not work.]

.quote[No, how about "Hi, this user has identified herself as (having a condition), which is probably why (this problem arose). Before we ban her … she seems to have her heart in the right place and has a lot to offer our community. Obviously, this would not apply to users who are violent or angry…" ]

???
Those 10 moderators were concerned that not everyone would speak up, and discussed pro-actively addressing situations.

<read quotes>

Discussions of moderator-initiated author advocacy in the data lacked any reference to whether it had actually been done successfully or whether authors would want this.

# Why is this interesting

All of these may occur in a wide variety of  settings 
- Complex organizational structure 
- Separation between authors and consumers 
- Use of GUIs for creating content 

---
# Case Study #2: Lymespace

Users actively intervene to improve accessibility, relative to cognitive symptoms of Lyme disease

“Brain fog” affects use of online content
- Distraction when faced with visuals ranging from animated advertisements to bold text
- Difficulty remembering the start of a long passage by the end of the same passage
- Getting lost among multiple pages of content

# Investigated Moderation


What kinds of moderation occurs? How to users respond?
- Qualitative analysis of 6 authors and their moderators

When does moderation occur and what happens after?
- Quantitative analysis of 600 threads

# Were moderated posts less accessible?
![:img Two bar charts showing random posts and pre-moderation posts. Pre-moderation posts had a significantly longer paragraph size (150 characters on average versus 100 for random posts).

# Were moderated posts less accessible?

# Alternatives to Moderation

"Soft Paternalism" [Mack et al, 2021](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3441852.3471207) 

Interfaces that suggest what to include in alt text are beneficial
  - Leads to more complete, detailed ALT text
  - Structure helps (e.g. types of content to include)
  - OK  to prefill with automatically generated text
