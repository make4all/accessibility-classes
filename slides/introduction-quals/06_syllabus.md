## Other Important Facts about this Class <!-- .element: class="r-fit-text"  -->

- **Language**:  I am Jen (preferred), or Dr. Mankoff or Prof. Mankoff
- **Religious Holidays**: Let me know if they will impact your participation
- **Inclusivity**: An important value in this class, and in HCI!

---
## A little more on Inclusivity

- Inclusivity does not (and should not) require disclosure, this goes for accessibility and ANYTHING else
- How can you ask for help without violating privacy or boundaries? I won't make you justify your requests for help or accommodations or pry into your life. 

Notes:
[not yet true] Especially because Biden's new Title IX regulations make me a mandatory reporter.

This is the most important thing I’m going to talk about today. Have I got everyone’s attention? You can’t miss this part

# Grading

Assignment completion and participation is required. 
- This is 15% of your grade. 
- However if you simply stop attending class or doing the work, your grade will be reduced based on the amount of class you miss. 

Competencies are the other 85% 

---
## Participation
- We will consider the whole student in assigning this grade and cannot give you a definitive formula

- We take your input on this: Participation is a space where you get to choose what works best for you. 

- Some things we look at
  - Did you turn in your assignments on time / show reasonable effort on them
  - Assignment completion considers whether you did everything, not how well you did it.
  - Includes asking questions in class (**self reported**)
  - Participating in discussion and exercises (**self reported**)
  - Participation in discussion outside of class (**based on activity**)

---
## Competencies

We use *competency based grading* because it prioritizes *accessibility* and *justice* and *flexibility* for students.

**Traditional grading** focuses on completion of required tasks

| 85% projects | 15% participation        |
|--------------|--------------------------|
| *project 1*  | *class attendance*       |
| project 2    | asking question in class |
| ...          | ...                      |


---
## What is competency-based grading?
**Competency-based grading** focuses on evidence of progress and learning

| learning goal 1              | learning goal 2     | learning goal 3            |
|------------------------------|---------------------|----------------------------|
| *Evidence: Project 1*        | Evidence: Project 1 | Evidence: Project 2        |
| *Evidence: Project 2*        | Evidence: Project 3 | Evidence: Project 4        |
| *Evidence: Project 4*        |                     |                            |
| *Evidence: Discussion posts* |                     | Evidence: Discussion posts |
| ...                          | ...                 | ...                        |


Teaching and learning are centered around *learning outcomes*. This changes how we plan, assess and grade the course.

## More detail on competencies (1/2)

- Competencies are the core learning goals in this class. 
- If you learn them all well, you will do well in the class
- You will have multiple opportunities to show us you learned them

You can find all of the competencies in [Outcomes](TODO)

---
## How Competencies Translate to Grades
- On any competency, you may be rated as below competent, competent or excellent. 
 - There are TODO competencies total
 - Your grade is: TODO

- We generally expect you will to achieve competency by the second time you try something, and continue improving to excellence over the quarter. 
  - If you achieve excellence, and then stop doing a thing (such as providing alt text), your score may drop. 
  - Similarly, if you don't try to do something until the very end of the quarter, even if you do it really well, we may not rate you as highly on that competency. 

---
# Example of Student  Competency  (1/2)


- The presentation slide deck and your first homework are mostly accessible, however you forget to describe any images. As a result, you score "Not Competent" on image descriptions.

--
- On your next assignment you take special care with image descriptions. You are marked "Competent" but the TA has some advice on how to be write more specific and useful descriptions

---
# Example of Student  Competency (2/2)

- You want to finish this, so the next time you include an image in a discussion post, you make sure to describe this, and ask the TA to review it. You followed their advice and you are marked "Excellent" <!-- .class="fragment" -->

- Over the rest of the quarter, you continue to describe all your images, and maintain "Excellent" in this competency <!-- .class="fragment" -->

## First Assignment: [AT Around Us](/assignments/finding-accessibility.html) (1/2)

- Find one computer access technology
- Find one about "the world"
- Find a description of it *by a disabled person who uses it* (first-person experience)
- Should  try at least one out yourself

---
## First Assignment: [AT Around Us](/assignments/finding-accessibility.html) (2/2)

- Try not to pick the same things as your classmates
- Should include a *first person video* 
- At least one should involve computers; 
- No disability dongles! 
Nothing too common (like glasses)

---
## Example 1: AAC (who uses AAC?)

- Kit Autie is an AAC user and YouTube Creator.
The video on the next slide shows the variety of options available over specific strengths
- Kit Autie also [describes why they use AAC and  ableist reactions they get when using it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z3YQ9F4SFAQ)

- Limitations: "*Languaging*" is a multi-person activity in which people can co-create access (or create ableism around access)

- Costs have come way down!! (free with in-app purchases)

## Considerations

- [No] AAC mealtime
  - The AAC user never addresses the audience
  - The  AAC user never comments on the experience of using it
- [No] Dynavox
  - It is highly scripted
  - It doesn't really review the device at hand
- [Borderline] Street crossing
  - City-produced video with first person account (see 2:10)
  - Limitations: Not universally available; Does not support DeafBlind 
  - Designed for people with visual impairments to cross the street

## A Note on Academic Integrity

Don't plagiarize. If you use text, quote it and reference it. Sharing is fine, but don't copy from each other. See our [Academic Conduct](academic-conduct.html) page for more details

WHy? UW policy and [*Citational Justice*](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-022-00793-1)  and thus an important expression of disability justice values in our class. Therefore

## GAI rules ([Full Rules](academic-conduct.html#generative-ai)) 1/2

You may use GAI for assignments and exams unless I specify that it may not be used or other guidelines. However:

- Cite the AI program you used in the artifact you hand in
- If it copies  text or closely copies ideas from other sources, you must cite those sources
- Do not use generative AI to plagiarize or cheat. For example, you may not use AI to create fake data and pass that off as based on real people. 

---
## GAI rules ([Full Rules](academic-conduct.html#generative-ai)) 2/2

You will be held to the same standards when you use generative AI as for any assignment, regardless of whether you or the AI created something, including:

- If you turn in artifacts that are not accessible, you will be graded accordingly
- If you turn in artifacts that contain false or incomplete claims, you will be graded accordingly
- You will be graded based on critical thinking and writing skills.
