#  When and Where is the Class Held?
This is an in person class. As much as possible, we ask that you
attend in person. That said, we know that many individual concerns may
make this a barrier. We will do our best to support remote
participation when there is a need for this due to a family
obligation, disability, or other concern.


See [Canvas]({{site.canvas}}) for all zoom meeting links for classes and office hours.

- **Class Time:** {{site.time}} (PDT)
- **Class Location:** {{site.room}}

*You can discuss matters with us privately on the [discussion
board]({{site.discussion}}). This notifies the whole course staff at
once and is usually faster than email.

Staff mailing list: [Mail](mailto:{{site.staff_email}})

## How do I reach other students in the class? 

We have a class [discussion board]({{site.discussion}}), where you can
make public posts that benefit the whole class, and are answered more
quickly because your fellow students can help the course staff by
responding also.

- This is the best way to ask questions about things like homework and programming
- Before posting, please search through the questions that have already been posted in case
      someone has already asked the same question.

Another great way to meet students is to come to class in person!

## How does Synchronous Remote Participation work?

When you are remote, ideally you will still participate synchronously. To participate synchronously, you need to do the following:

1. Post in [the class discussion]({{site.discussion}}/4631278) to find or report who your zoom buddy is
2. Attend via zoom and participate in discussions with the help of your zoom buddy
3. Report who your zoom buddy was, and how you participated, in your weekly survey


## Will lectures be recorded? 

Class sessions **will be recorded** when possible (guest lecturers may
refuse this). Recordings will only be accessible to students enrolled
in the course to review materials.

The University and Zoom have FERPA-compliant agreements in place to
protect the security and privacy of UW Zoom accounts. 

Students who connect by Zoom but do not wish to be recorded should:
- Change their Zoom screen name to a school appropriate screen name
that hides any personal identifying information such as their name or
UW Net ID
- Not share their computer audio or video during their Zoom sessions  (please notify us first!).


##  Expectations and Grading

While grading is a necessary part of what we do at UW, I want to focus
this class on learning; and to ensure that my approach to assessment
is inclusive and focuses on a justice based approach. There has been a
lot of [innovation in
assessment](https://online.suny.edu/innovativeassessments/) in recent
years, driven partly by COVID-19. We have tried to learn from this in our grading.

**There will not be quizzes, or a midterm or final exam**. Instead, your knowledge will be assessed 
[Competency based
grading](https://aurora-institute.org/cw_post/cbe-in-practice-grading/)  in alignment with the disability justice focus in this
course. A portion of your grade will also be based on participation and effort. 

## What is "*Competency Based Grading*"? 
 [Competency based
grading](https://aurora-institute.org/cw_post/cbe-in-practice-grading/) separates out *how* you learn a skill from *whether you
know it.* Many of these competencies are assessed repeatedly. *I don't
care if you get them wrong at first*, as long as you eventually learn
them. If you learn them all, and participate fully in the class, you
will get an A.


In the image below, you can see how traditional grading assigns a score
for each assignment and adds them together. If you score badly on your 
first assignment, that negatively affects your grade, *even if* you demonstrate that you've
learned everything you needed to know in it during later assignments. In contrast
competency-based grading is structured around learning goals. All of the different
things you do that demonstrate progress on those learning goals are grouped together
to help assign a score on that learning goal. 

![Explanation of competency-based grading. In a competency system teaching learning and grading are centered around learning outcomes. This changes how we plan assess and grade. It shifts us toward learning and away from completion/compliance. From the NYC Department of Education Competency Collaborative]({{site.baseurl}}/assets/img/competence-explanation.png)


The competencies needed for this course are listed on the [assignments
page](assignments/index.html), and can all be found in canvas as well.

Each time you turn in an assignment, you tell *us* which competencies
we should assess. We may also decide to assess competencies such as
whether a document is accessible, with accessible image descriptions.
If an assignment is *not* accessible we *will not assess any
competencies in it*. Once you achieve competency, we expect you to
maintain it -- for example, repeatedly turning in inaccessible images
after achieving competency in image descriptions will lower your
score.

When you we assess a competency, we rate your skill as "no evidence"
"below competent" "basic knowledge" or "excellent". Various
combinations of "basic" "excellent" and "below competent" result in
various final grades in the class, with all excellents being a 4.0 and
the grade going down based on the number of competents versus
excellents. However, if even 1 skill  is below
competence, the highest possible grade in the class is a 3.2.

You can
view your progress on each competency in Canvas (Excellent is called
"Mastery" there). **Click on the competency to see details on whether
you are "competent" or "excellent"**.

## What else will I be graded on?

### 85%: Competencies 
Competencies are 85% of your grade in the class. See the previous
question for details on how a grade is calculated from your
competencies.

Your scores on these competencies determine your grade as follows:

- Base grade: Number of Competents/2.5 + Number of Excellents/2
- Final grade: Base grade - (Number of Non-Competents/2)

### 15%: Assignment Completion, Participation and Effort
Your effort grade will reflect your participation in the class across
multiple dimensions such as whether you answerd reading questions;
participated in discussions and exercises in class (self reported);
and to what degree you completed all assignments.

If you participate remotely, or miss a class, you may be asked  to
engage in additional work before, after, or during lecture to ensure
that you have the most similar experience possible to students who are
in person. 

## Does the class have a regrading policy?

Reflecting on feedback is one of the most valuable ways you can learn
from your mistakes, and we encourage you to do so.
It is also possible for the graders to make mistakes. If that happens
we certainly would like to correct the error. 

However, please note the
following:
- Because this class is competency based, you don't necessarily need a regrade, you just need to show that you have learned this competency in this OR a future assignment. Most competencies show up in more than one place
- When you request a regrade, we may look at the entire assessment, homework or reflection. Therefore,
it is possible for to lose a competency as well as gain one in this process.

If you have a
question about a grade you received or if you feel the grade you
received is incorrect, please **[email an
instructor](mailto:{{site.staff_email}}) for an appointment to discuss
the assignment and your grade in detail**.
